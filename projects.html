          <p class="card-text">Classification modeling of reddit comments (not posts, but rather the comments attached to them) from the conspiracy and news subreddits. I chose these two subreddits as a challenge to see how well machine learning algorithms could distinguish between two subreddits with similar content. The resulting models can predict comment origin with 75% accuracy.</p>

          <p class="card-text">The first check Separator I made worked perfectly well for times when my girlfriend paid for groceries on her card and needed reimbursement for me. That wasn't always the case though, and so I set about to create a check separator that would work regardless of who paid for what bills and for as many people as could conceivably need to split bills. Son of Check Separator works wonderfully well for separating out a pile of receipts and making adequate payments.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Web Scrapers</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I have made several web scrapers that perform various tasks. One scrapes a website to see if there are any products of a certain brand in stock, another scrapes to see if our home network IP has changed so we can reconfigure a web server. Rememberance_scraper was not only the first web scraper program I made, but also a venture into using the raspberry pi and breadboards. In rememberance of those who have died from COVID-19, the Kentucky governor lights up the governor's mansion in green every day there are those dying from SARS-COV-2. I created a program that scrapes the number of those who have died and blinks a green light for each person in memory of their life and to honor them. These small scraper programs were my first entries into webscraping using Python.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Craps game</h5>
          <p class="card-text">The very first project I ever tried to work on was the creation of a console based craps game in Python. Knowing that I was a new student to Python, and that craps was a complicated game with lots of rules, I knew it would be a challenge to complete. It was an extreme undertaking and I eventually abaonded it when I realized there was a lot more to learn before I could have this program be what I wanted it to be. I want to up the stakes and create a craps program that can run on the web with its own GUI.</p>
