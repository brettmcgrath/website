    <h4>Setting sail for the moon</h4><br>
    <h6>February 8, 2020</h6><br>
    
    <p>Though this is my first blog post, I feel like I could have started this blog a long time ago and yet have so much more to learn. I started learning Python in September 2019, teaching myself with the help of Python tutorials on Treehouse and Udemy. My first Python project (see my GitHub portfolio) was a short program I developed to streamline the task of splitting grocery receipts between me and my girlfriend. While calculating the who owes who from grocery expenses was never a challenging task with a calculator, the program I made takes the thought out of it.</p>
    
    <p>Since I started, I have made it a habit to forgo a lot of the small coding projects in the Treehouse and Udemy videos; I had a better idea! I’m coding things that are interesting to me, pertain to real-world needs, and display the same skills demanded by the tutorials. I have found this to keep me very engaged and excited about writing Python. It has also allowed me to skip ahead, so to speak, and dig further to advance my overall programming knowledge. My GitHub portfolio isn’t a regurgitation of bootcamp projects either coded alongside video tutorials or copy and pasted. My portfolio is my own work, from scratch, start to finish; my ideas, my code.</p>
    
    <p>While I am happily writing my own code, I recently purchased a book of 150 programming challenges that I am eager to delve into. Python by examples by Nichola Lacey is soon to be my before-bed code challenge primer. If you’re reading this because you’re interested in learning to code, I would recommend you check it out! Nichola Lacey’s book isn’t the only thing I am reading on Python right now. A friend of mine recently recommended A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. This book is really great at letting me organize my thoughts and answer a lot of the questions I have about design theory, complexity, and workflow. My friend, a software engineer at Microsoft, says she wished she would have read this earlier in her own programming journey. I’m happy to read it at this place in mine. When writing code, I think about what I am reading of Ousterhout’s philosophy and try to program strategically instead of tactically, think about the bigger picture instead of just coding to put bandages on gaping wounds.</p>
    
    <p>A lot of my time coding right now is spent on my pirate game. I have found that the sky is the limit for this game and all the skills I learn in tutorials I can demonstrate here. Wherein Treehouse tutorials, object-oriented programming seemed like something that they rush through and don’t really explain, the need for OOP in my pirate game has allowed me to explore concepts I previously had trouble with on tutorials alone. I have had to do a lot of self-searching, and I still have a lot to learn! Failure has been the best way to learn and with every error coded, I learn powerful lessons of both Python’s powers and limitations.</p>
    
    <p>I would like to introduce a lot of aspects not currently found in the pirate game. I would like to add the ability to customize ships with better equipment, create new types of cannon shot for different kinds of ship damage, and allow players to sail to other ports with cargo that can generate in-game cash to be used for equipment, crew, etc. I am motivated to see what I can create. At the age of 12 or 13 I played an online, text-based, multiplayer role-playing game called Utopia. It was around the same time I dabbled in HTML and was marveled in thinking about what must have gone into the creation of Utopia. I'm inspired to create something similar.</p>
    
    <p>I currently work at a grocery store and I’m not the only one there who is learning to code. A co-worker congratulated me on my first program the other day (check separator) and asked me what keeps me motivated. I’m motivated by the need to learn new things; I’m a lifelong learner and crave knowledge. Every successful line of code is a victory to be cherished, every fixed error is an accomplishment I celebrate. I’m motivated to create useful tools for myself and others and to find meaningful work in something I have become truly passionate about.</p>
    
    <p>A sign hung in my mom’s office before she passed away. It read:</p>
    
    <p>“Shoot for the moon, even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars.”</p>
    
    <p>Let’s code our way out of this galaxy.</p>
