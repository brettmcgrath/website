    <h4>Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride!</h4><br>
    <h6>May 6, 2020</h6><br>

  
    <p>It has been a long time since I have written anything here, and while this blog is located at the same place it has been since January 30 (brettmcgrath.dev), it just received a major display overhaul as of a few days ago. A lot has happened since my last blog post. I have learned a lot, coded a lot, and been swept up in the changes brought on by a global pandemic. I have done my best to capitalize on the current situation and redirect as much energy to the beginnings of my new tech career. I remain excited, hopeful, and committed.</p>

    <p>As I stated in a post on February 15, I was accepted into Code Louisville for the May 2020 cohort! I have been super excited to start this journey and for the opportunity to be able to learn and network through this program. Code Louisville starts with a front-end web development course that uses Treehouse courses as a foundation to learn HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript. Eager to start learning, I asked previous students to share the syllabus with me and enthusiastically started the pre-work and coursework before classes even started. </p>

    <p>By the time the pre-work was due (I believe on the 19th of last month), I had long completed it and almost all actual coursework for the entirety of the class. I was consistently ranking on the top of the charts of students in my cohort who were completing the most tutorials, usually in first place. I had heard from another Code Louisville student that the program was allowing students who had graduated from the front-end class to take multiple back end programming classes concurrently. Since I had already come so far, I asked the program staff if it would be possible to take another class while I completed the front-end course. They gave me a better option: skip the front-end class altogether and advance to another class. I was thrilled. </p>

    <p>After a lot of thought and discussion with friends working as developers, I decided to take the JavaScript course and will be starting with the first class this Monday. I officially completed all of the coursework for the front-end class on Treehouse today, and well, I guess you see the results of what would have been a submission for the web development project—you’re on it right now! </p>

    <p>The new design of brettmcgrath.dev is a vast improvement over the previous site which was hastily thrown together by a fly-by-night template provided by GoDaddy.com. Taking the time to write my own HTML and CSS has allowed me better control and presentation of content. This site is and will continue to be a work in progress. It will surely become more interactive as I learn and create more JavaScript. </p>

    <p>While many people have spent their social isolation periods running out of things to do, I have been able to use this period to learn as much as I can. Some lessons come quickly, and others are long time commitments for a small reward. I spent most of a day learning all about webservers and domain hosting when I decided to part with GoDaddy.com. A whole day of learning allowed me to save me money on hosting every month and use GitHub as the single point of content delivery to brettmcgrath.dev. I now have a better understanding about how webservers work. I saved money, probably time in the future, and learned valuable skills. </p>

    <p>Today I decided to clean up my GitHub account a bit. Each project now has its own repository and description as opposed to my use of a portfolio repository which I used previously. I think the presentation of this is a lot cleaner and will make it easier for people to see what I have been up to. On the downside, when I deleted my portfolio repo, it also deleted the majority of my GitHub use history. As a result it now looks like I started using GitHub three days ago. Oh well. </p>

    <p>Some of the things I have been creating since last writing have been incredibly useful! I recently uploaded some web scrapers that I made in Python for various things. The ip_scraper I made for my girlfriend (per her request) to determine if our IP address changes. Another I made to flash a green light in honor of those who die in my state from COVID-19. Not as useful as other things, but a way to answer the governor’s call to light our houses up green on days that there are COVID-19 fatalities in our state. </p>

    <p>Most useful perhaps of all that I have done in the last month is finally creating an even more useful check separator that I have called Son of Check Separator. The check separator was the first program I ever wrote from scratch in Python. While helpful in splitting the costs of grocery bills (or any other bills) between two people, it could only be used for two people and only when the bills were paid by one person. Son of Check Separator allows for anyone to calculate who owes despite how many people are paying and who has already paid. I now use this program once every two weeks of so after grocery trips. </p>

    <p>I am certain that I have missed something in this post. I have been hard at work learning, creating, and building my way up to proving myself ready to start a career as a developer. With every challenge there have been an equal number of opportunities to learn and grow. Despite global crisis, I feel prepared to move forward towards a new and better me. </p>

    <p>I’m reminded of a song I used to sing (and dance) with some coworkers when I worked as a nursing assistant at the hospital: “Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride. Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no! I got to keep on movin’!”</p>
