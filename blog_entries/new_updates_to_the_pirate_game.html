    <h4>New updates to the pirate game!</h4><br>
    <h6>February 16, 2020</h6><br>
    
    <p>If this is your first exposure to my pirate game (yet to be named), you can see the latest code in my GitHub portfolio. This is my first large project and we are at 291 lines of code and counting. I realize that I should break up the code into several files to make it more manageable. I have yet to do this and this update will be coming soon. I am trying to get better on commenting my code. There is already A LOT going on in this game, and I should be a little heavier on the comments than I have been. I have been commenting after the fact and should comment as I go or even before adding in new features.</p>
    
    <p>While we are talking about weaknesses before strengths, I need to brush up on git. I have started, but not finished the Treehouse git tutorial. So far, I have been deleting and adding new updates manually to the GitHub site. I would actually like to learn to stage and commit changes, though I ran into a world of headaches trying to do so through Microsoft Visual Studio Code a few weeks ago. I am new to this, unfamiliar with git, and it is only a matter of time before this minor turbulence is left far behind the wake of progress I have made.</p>
    
    <p>I’m really impressed with what I have so far! The game runs off a menu, starting the game’s first character, named Athos Sangiovese, in the port of Nassau with a list of four ships to choose from. Ships can vary in size, amount of cannon and crew (coming soon!), etc. When I started making this game, I created ship class objects and then a battle function to the main character’s ship against an NPC ship that at present really has no mind of its own and just battles it out until the end.</p>
    
    <p>The game now features the ability to choose your ship, battle a random enemy ship, and select cargo to place aboard your vessel. This cargo adds weight to the ship, which I would like to integrate with features that deduct money from your gold balance, and make ships slower as they are more heavily laden, thus detracting from their ability to flee or approach enemy ships. Below is a list of other plans I have for this game:</p>
    
    <p>1. Customization of ships to add better, faster sails, heavier cannon, etc.</p>
    
    <p>2. Creation of a speed algorithm that takes into account the type of sails, weight of a ship, damage to sails and hull, and any other factors that may affect ship speed.</p>
    
    <p>3. The ability to hire crew to maintain the ship at sea.</p>
    
    <p>4. Development of a loss system by which cargo, ship hulls, and sails are damaged in battle, crew may die in battle.</p>
    
    <p>5. Creation of new ports to sail to for trading resources</p>
    
    <p>6. Creation of property purchase menu through which you can own capital in port cities</p>
    
    <p>And if I haven’t made it clear, my long-term goal for this game is for it to be multiplayer and have a web presence through which I can play it with my friends. As I stated in my previous blog post, I am going to be learning to use Django to allow me to facilitate this. I’m super excited about the possibilities for this game. So far it has been a great way to play with everything I learn and encourage me to dig deeper.</p>
