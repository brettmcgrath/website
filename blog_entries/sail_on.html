    <h4>Sail on! ... Good times never felt so good!</h4><br>
    <h6>February 15, 2020</h6><br>

    <p>I first started the “Beginning Python” track on Treehouse on September 5, 2019. This track is an introductory set of Python tutorials and code challenges spanning 16 hours of video time. I have watched and re-watched these tutorials and have finally, today, made it to the end of this beginning tutorial track!</p>

    <p>So what does this mean? I’m not a Python expert; I’ve merely skimmed the surface of the basic ins and outs of what it takes to write software, but I’m really happy to celebrate this milestone and take the time here to reflect on where I am at in my journey. I cannot recommend Treehouse enough for those looking to learn to code. It’s not perfect, and around the time the videos started to cover object-oriented programming, many concepts are thrown at you without a lot of explanation or context. If you’re learning like I am, don’t worry, stay the course, you’ll pick up all you need eventually, likely from your own explorations in debugging or writing more efficient and productive code. I’ve learned most from my mistakes and you will too.</p>

    <p>I’ll lay out my learning method so far, which seems to have worked for me. I always wonder if there are more efficient ways to learn, or if my progress is too slow. I ALWAYS wonder what percentage of my time should be divided between watching tutorials and actually writing code. I’m also always interested to hear what has worked for other people. I began my journey taking sort of a backseat approach to learning. I would watch videos, read other people’s code and try to figure out how it worked. I started, but didn’t finish, a terminal-based craps game. Progress was halted by the thought that I might need to learn object-oriented programming concepts or ways to connect to SQL databases before I could do all I needed to. Looking back on it, I am confident I could have finished the program, but definitely have more tools in my Python toolbox now. One lesson I keep learning is that I shouldn’t let what I don’t know yet hinder me from creating with what I do know. I can only imagine all the ways the pirate game will evolve or could be programmed differently. One of my all-consuming thoughts is whether or not the attack feature should remain outside the Ship class or be a Ship-based method. Is there a right answer? If you have no idea what I’m referring to, see my GitHub portfolio for the most up to date pirate game code.</p>

    <p>I am very interested in how the journey of teaching oneself to code is for other people. I have spent time looking at my friends’ GitHub repositories to see what other people use in their own portfolios. I have seen through social media that I’m not the only person who has drastically shifted career goals since college, and several people with whom I studied Spanish and Anthropology with a decade ago have now found a home in the tech industry. There are many roads to Rome and they each have come to tech through different paths. Sometimes programming became a small aspect or improvement on an existing job, sometimes they were looking through a fresh start and found a boot camp, online or in person.</p>

    <p>Louisville was fortunate to be a city with a no-tuition training program called Code Louisville (https://codelouisville.org). The program lost its grant funding and became a tuition-based part of JCTC (a local community college). Several people I know have attended Code Louisville and found it to be helpful in not only their learning process, but to be able to network with people working in tech in Louisville and create a path and portfolio that will lead to a new career. I was very happy to hear that Code Louisville is once again fully funded and tuition free! I was one of the first to sign up to participate in the next class session and hope that my application is accepted for classes starting in May 2020! If you are reading this as a programming novice sign up now before the wait list grows. The wait list that they once had was wiped and the sooner you apply the better chances you have of getting into this next cohort: https://codelouisville.org/learn/apply </p>

    <p>Code Louisville relies on Treehouse tutorials for a lot of their material. If I am accepted into the program, the first class teaches web design and basic front-end development which require Treehouse videos on HTML and CSS as prerequisite. I’m going to start down the “Exploring Django” track (https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/exploring-django) next which contains many of the HTML and CSS tutorials I will need as prerequisites and also allows me to build on what I have been doing with my pirate game, hopefully moving it beyond the terminal and onto the worldwide web!</p>
