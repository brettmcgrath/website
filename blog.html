              <p class="card-text">I have spent a few hours now looking at code and not actually writing much new. As mentioned previously, I realized that my game was getting fairly long for one file and that I should break it up into smaller sections as is best practice. I really thought this was going to be easier than it was, but a few hours later I haven’t managed to break it up much at all! Breaking it up initially presented with lots of problems untangling a spaghetti of classes, functions and variables I tried to import from one file to the next. This was the first time I had ever attempted doing this, and I thought it would be as simple as importing math, sys, random, or any other Python library. I was in for a surprise!...</p>

              <p class="card-text">If this is your first exposure to my pirate game (yet to be named), you can see the latest code in my GitHub portfolio. This is my first large project and we are at 291 lines of code and counting. I realize that I should break up the code into several files to make it more manageable. I have yet to do this and this update will be coming soon. I am trying to get better on commenting my code. There is already A LOT going on in this game, and I should be a little heavier on the comments than I have been. I have been commenting after the fact and should comment as I go or even before adding in new features...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Though this is my first blog post, I feel like I could have started this blog a long time ago and yet have so much more to learn. I started learning Python in September 2019, teaching myself with the help of Python tutorials on Treehouse and Udemy. My first Python project (see my GitHub portfolio) was a short program I developed to streamline the task of splitting grocery receipts between me and my girlfriend. While calculating the who owes who from grocery expenses was never a challenging task with a calculator, the program I made takes the thought out of it...</p>
